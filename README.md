## Overview

This website was inspired by the new HBO series "House of the Dragons." It pulls data from the [official HBO site](https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/official-guide). The main objective is to create a forum for GOT/HOTD fans to share their opinion or experience on the new episode of "House of the Dragons."

## Workflow
The website consist of 3 pages: home, characters, and forum. The home page introduces the "House of the Dragons" series and contains a menu that'll take you to the characters page or forum. The characters page will display all the main characters and will allow you to read about each character by clicking their image. Lastly, the forum page will allow you to share your experience with other GOT/HOTD fans.
